# Solidity Practice with Hardhat

This is a sample Hardhat project designed as a Solidity practice exercise. The project includes a simple Solidity contract, tests, and a deployment script, allowing you to experience the full cycle of smart contract development using Hardhat.

## Overview

This repository serves as a personal practice project to improve my Solidity skills. It demonstrates:
- Writing a simple Solidity contract.
- Testing the contract using Hardhat's testing framework.
- Deploying the contract with a deployment script.
- Gaining hands-on experience with Hardhat and Ethereum smart contract development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- **Hardhat:** This project uses Hardhat for development and testing.
- **npm or yarn:** Package manager to install dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alqeren1/solidity_class.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd solidity_class
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

Try running some of the following tasks with Hardhat:

- **Get Help:**
  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat help
  ```

- **Run Tests:**
  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```

- **Test with Gas Reporting:**
  
  ```bash
  REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
  ```

- **Run a Local Node:**
  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat node
  ```

- **Deploy the Contract:**
  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
  ```

## Project Structure

- **contracts/**  
  Contains the Solidity contract(s) used in this project.
  
- **scripts/**  
  Deployment scripts to deploy the contract to a local or test network.
  
- **test/**  
  Test files for verifying the contract functionality using Hardhat.

## Experience & Learning

This project allowed me to:
- Gain practical experience in writing and deploying Solidity contracts.
- Learn to use Hardhat for testing and deploying smart contracts.
- Understand the workflow of Ethereum smart contract development from code to deployment.
